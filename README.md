# Veritas

**AI created the work. Veritas keeps it true.**

Veritas is a continuous evidence-integrity agent for AI-created knowledge work. It records claim-level provenance when a decision packet is created, watches registered evidence for meaningful changes, calculates the downstream blast radius, performs minimal repairs across Google Workspace artifacts, preserves human edits, and independently verifies the repaired packet.

## Hackathon target

- Primary track: The Taskmaster
- Secondary prize targets: Best Architectural Design, Individual/Hobbyist, Best Multimodal UX
- Demo vertical: Q3 Executive Review decision packet
- Production boundary: real Google Workspace APIs and real Google Cloud services; no simulated actions in the recorded demo

## Non-negotiable loop

```text
evidence change
  -> immutable snapshot
  -> semantic delta
  -> registered lineage traversal
  -> typed repair plan
  -> policy/approval gate
  -> minimal cross-artifact execution
  -> independent verification
  -> scoped integrity certificate
```

## Current status

Phase 0 is the active build gate. The product contract, canonical demo scenario, data contracts, and verification strategy must pass before Phase 1 begins.

See:

- [Product contract](docs/product-contract.md)
- [Canonical demo scenario](docs/demo-scenario.md)
- [Phase gates](docs/phases.md)
- [Verification strategy](docs/verification-strategy.md)
- [Claim Manifest decision record](docs/architecture-decisions/0001-claim-manifest.md)

## Phase 0 verification

```bash
node scripts/verify-phase-0.mjs
```
